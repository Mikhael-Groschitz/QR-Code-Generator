# QR-Code-Generator
This Python code creates a graphical interface using Tkinter to generate and save QR codes from links. It is a simple and interactive tool designed to improve my knowledge of Python and its libraries

This Python code uses Tkinter to create a graphical interface that allows the user to generate and save a QR code from an inputted link. The main functions are:

generate_qr() Function: This function is triggered when the "Generate QR Code" button is clicked. It retrieves the link inputted by the user, creates the QR code with PyQRCode, prompts the user where they want to save the QR code, and saves it as a PNG file. It also updates a status label to indicate the success of the operation.

Main Window Configuration: The main window is created with Tkinter, including a label to instruct the user, a text entry to input the link, a button to trigger the QR code generation, and a status label to display messages.

These combined functions provide a simple and interactive way to generate QR codes from links inputted by the user.
